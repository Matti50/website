          <h2>My learning process</h2>
          <p>Trying to scape tutorial hell. I decided that it was time
            to get down to work so I took courage and started the 
            development of the first version of my website. 
            I am also currently researching about programming and IoT stuff
            like Arduino. The site is focused to be a "repo" of my progress as
            a developer. Here you will see my finished work and current process of my 
            projects. I am not currently working but studying at UNLP from La Plata, Argentina.
